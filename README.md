I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the `stack_overflow_with_ds.ipynb` file.

### Project Motivation
Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the Boston and Seatle Airbnb datasets were collected and investigated. Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

1. Which country has the highest job satisfaction has a developer?
2. Different between job satisfaction has a developer, From Undergraduate computer field or those who different fields?
3. Since developers who contribute to open source have higher salary then who are not?

### Result Summary
In this notebook we did the analysis about developers from Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019, and these are the summary of what we have done.

1. We measure the job satisfaction level for each country and found that United States has the highest job satisfaction level in the world, and 5 of top 10 countries with the highest job satisfaction level are located in Europe.
2. We then looked at their undergraduate major and found that developers whose undergraduate major is not IT-related have slightly better job satisfaction.
3. Finally, we found that developers who contribute more to the open source have the higher salary.
